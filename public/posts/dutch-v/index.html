    Dutch van der Linde: Early Life and Origins
  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">Dutch van der Linde, a central figure in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, was born in the mid-1850s to Greta, a woman of English descent, and a father of Dutch ancestry. His family lived near Philadelphia. Dutch’s father fought for the Union in the American Civil War and tragically died in a battle in Pennsylvania. This loss left a deep mark on Dutch, fostering a lifelong grudge against Southerners.</p>
<p class="component-content component">As a child, Dutch was rebellious and often at odds with his mother. At the age of 15, his defiant nature led him to run away from home. Years later, in 1881, his mother passed away and was buried in Blackwater. Dutch only learned of her death years later through an uncle.</p>

  <h3 id="the-birth-of-an-outlaw" class="pagebody-header">
    The Birth of an Outlaw
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">Dutch valued freedom and independence above all else, dreaming of living a life unbound by societal constraints. To achieve these ideals, he turned to crime as a means of survival and self-determination.</p>
<p class="component-content component">In the mid-1870s, Dutch had a fateful encounter with Hosea Matthews, a skilled con artist, at a campfire near the road to Chicago. Hosea tried to con and rob Dutch, only to realize that Dutch had simultaneously stolen from him. Amused and impressed by each other&rsquo;s cunning, the two formed a bond and decided to work together. This partnership laid the foundation for the infamous Van der Linde gang, an outlaw group united by shared ideals and a desire for freedom.</p>

    Arthur Morgan: The First Protégé (1877)
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">In 1877, Dutch van der Linde and Hosea Matthews encountered a 14-year-old street orphan named Arthur Morgan. Recognizing the boy&rsquo;s potential, the pair took him under their wing. Dutch and Hosea taught Arthur essential life skills such as reading, writing, hunting, fighting, shooting, and horse riding. Over time, Arthur became their first protégé and, alongside Dutch and Hosea, formed the old guard of the Van der Linde gang.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Around this time, Dutch entered a romantic relationship with Susan Grimshaw, a fellow gang member. However, their relationship eventually ended when Dutch fell deeply in love with another woman named Annabelle.</p>

</div><p class="component-content component">In 1885, Dutch came across a group of Illinois homesteaders attempting to lynch a 12-year-old boy named John Marston for stealing from them. Dutch intervened, saving John’s life, and subsequently welcomed him into the gang. Much like with Arthur, Dutch took John under his wing, teaching him how to read, write, fight, shoot, and ride.</p>

This period marked the beginning of Dutch’s dream of creating a family bound by shared ideals of freedom and loyalty—a dream that would ultimately define his leadership and the gang&rsquo;s destiny.</p>
