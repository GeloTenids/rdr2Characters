    Hosea Matthews: Backstory and Role in the Van der Linde Gang
  </h2>
</div>
<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h3 id="early-life" class="pagebody-header">
    Early Life
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">Hosea Matthews was born around 1844 and raised in the mountains. He described his father as a man who lived a life of &ldquo;sin and debauchery that would make an emperor blush&rdquo; but mentioned that he loved him, despite only seeing him for three months throughout his life.</p>
<p class="component-content component">In his younger years, Hosea briefly pursued acting, with aspirations of becoming a comedian. However, his career as an actor was short-lived, and he turned to a life of crime. One of his earliest brushes with death came when he was caught stealing a chicken by a hill-country sheriff who attempted to hang him. A riot broke out at the hanging when people deemed the punishment unfair. In the chaos, an unknown man shot the rope, freeing Hosea, while the sheriff himself was hanged. Hosea escaped with only a sore neck.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h3 id="meeting-dutch-van-der-linde" class="pagebody-header">
    Meeting Dutch van der Linde
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">In the mid-1870s, Hosea crossed paths with Dutch van der Linde at a campfire on the road to Chicago. The two initially tried to con and rob each other but quickly recognized each other&rsquo;s skill and wit. They laughed at their failed attempts and decided to team up.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Their partnership began with a con in Kettering, Ohio, where they posed as international merchants. They swindled twelve locals into investing $300 in a fictitious Portuguese shipping company. Though their scheme was uncovered, and they were arrested by Sheriff Carmichael, the pair escaped on March 9, 1877, after tying up the sheriff and robbing him.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h3 id="mentorship-and-the-formation-of-the-gang" class="pagebody-header">
    Mentorship and the Formation of the Gang
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">Not long after their escape, Hosea and Dutch encountered a teenage delinquent named Arthur Morgan. They took him under their wing, mentoring him and helping him grow into a skilled and loyal member of the gang. Hosea, Dutch, and Arthur formed the core &ldquo;old guard&rdquo; of the Van der Linde gang, which would expand over the years.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h3 id="marriage-and-loss" class="pagebody-header">
    Marriage and Loss
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">At some point, Hosea fell in love with and married a woman named Bessie. Deeply in love, he even left the gang temporarily to live a quieter life with her. However, he eventually returned to the gang, with Bessie&rsquo;s understanding and support. Tragically, Bessie passed away before 1899, leaving Hosea devastated. He admitted to being &ldquo;drunk for a year&rdquo; following her death.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h3 id="key-events-in-the-gangs-history" class="pagebody-header">
    Key Events in the Gang&rsquo;s History
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">In 1887, Hosea participated in the gang&rsquo;s first major bank robbery alongside Dutch and Arthur. They raided the bank of Lee and Hoyt, stealing $5000 in gold. Afterward, the gang lingered in the area, giving much of the stolen money to orphanages and the poor.</p>
<p class="component-content component">In the gang&rsquo;s early days, Hosea and Dutch shared a vision of helping the less fortunate. However, as the gang became more focused on its survival and increasingly violent, Hosea grew disillusioned. Despite his reservations, he remained loyal to Dutch and the gang.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h3 id="role-in-the-gang-by-1899" class="pagebody-header">
    Role in the Gang by 1899
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">By 1899, Hosea was the oldest and most senior member of the Van der Linde gang, serving as Dutch’s trusted lieutenant and advisor. His intelligence and level-headedness earned him great respect among the gang. While Hosea shared Dutch’s ideals, he preferred peaceful methods of making money and maintained a more pragmatic view of the gang’s future.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Though loyal, Hosea&rsquo;s wisdom and practicality often set him apart, as he foresaw the challenges and ultimate downfall awaiting the gang.</p>

    Hosea Matthews: Personality and Role in the Gang
  </h2>
</div>
<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h3 id="personality-traits-and-skills" class="pagebody-header">
    Personality Traits and Skills
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">Hosea Matthews is an intelligent and cunning outlaw with over two decades of experience as a con artist and thief. Known for his wit and charm, Hosea relies on his sharp mind rather than brute force to navigate challenging situations. A slick talker, he excels at elaborate schemes designed to swindle people out of their money, often adopting various personas to distract and manipulate his targets.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Unlike Dutch or Arthur, Hosea avoids violence when possible, favoring non-violent strategies for resolving conflicts. However, he is not entirely opposed to using force when the situation demands it:</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>He killed a man who attempted to rob him.</li>
<li>He pulled a gun on Bill Williamson and threatened him.</li>
<li>He participated in the assault on Braithwaite Manor.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">Despite his generally calm and patient demeanor, Hosea has moments where his temper flares. For example, he once caught Sean MacGuire sleeping while on lookout and angrily berated him, even threatening to slit Sean’s throat in a rare and uncharacteristic outburst.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h3 id="relationship-with-dutch-and-the-gang" class="pagebody-header">
    Relationship with Dutch and the Gang
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">Hosea has been Dutch van der Linde&rsquo;s closest friend and right-hand man since at least 1877. Over the years, their partnership solidified, with Hosea becoming one of Dutch&rsquo;s most trusted confidants. By 1899, Hosea rivaled, if not surpassed, Arthur Morgan in his status as Dutch&rsquo;s most valued lieutenant.</p>
<p class="component-content component">However, their relationship is tested throughout the events of the story. As Dutch&rsquo;s behavior becomes increasingly brash and violent, it conflicts with Hosea&rsquo;s preference for peaceful and calculated approaches. Hosea expresses remorse for the gang&rsquo;s escalating brutality and his role in enabling it. Around the campfire, he laments that the gang has devolved into &ldquo;a bunch of killers&rdquo; and admits that he dislikes both the violence and himself for tolerating it.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h3 id="role-as-a-fatherly-figure" class="pagebody-header">
    Role as a Fatherly Figure
  </h3>
</div><p class="component-content component">Hosea is viewed as a fatherly figure by the gang, second only to Dutch in influence. Unlike Dutch, whose leadership grows erratic over time, Hosea is widely respected for his level-headedness and wisdom. Even Arthur Morgan, who deeply loves Dutch like a father, writes in his journal that he &ldquo;loves Hosea even more.&rdquo;</p>
