## Sadie Adler

Sadie Adler grew up in a harsh environment, where she learned to hunt animals and ride horses from a young age. In September 1896, she married Jake Adler, and the couple settled on a ranch in the state of Ambarino. They shared their work equally and enjoyed a happy marriage.

However, their peaceful life came to a tragic end when their house was robbed by the O'Driscoll Boys. During the attack, Jake was killed, and Sadie was forced to hide in the cellar for days to avoid the same fate. 

### Joining the Van der Linde Gang

Shortly after the attack, members of the Van der Linde gang—Dutch, Arthur, and Micah—arrived at the homestead, searching for supplies. The three confronted and killed the O'Driscolls occupying the house. After hearing the gunfire, Sadie emerged from the cellar to find Micah looting her home. A heated confrontation ensued, during which she threatened him with a knife, and he accidentally knocked over a lantern, setting the house on fire. 

Dutch and Arthur intervened, calming both Sadie and Micah. Dutch, recognizing her situation, decided to bring her back to their camp. Despite the gang's outlaw status, Sadie chose to stay with them, beginning her transformation from a ranch wife to a formidable outlaw.

Sadie's resilience and fierce independence became defining traits, and she earned her place as a valued and respected member of the Van der Linde gang.
