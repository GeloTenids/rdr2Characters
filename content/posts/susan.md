## Susan Grimshaw  

Susan Grimshaw was one of the original members of the Van der Linde gang, alongside Dutch van der Linde, Hosea Matthews, and Arthur Morgan. At some point, Susan and Dutch became romantically involved, spending long nights playing poker with the gang, often sitting in Dutch's lap. Their relationship eventually ended, and Dutch moved on to another woman named Annabelle.  

Despite their breakup, Susan maintained a close association with Dutch and remained on good terms with him. Over time, she gained his respect and became a trusted figure within the gang, eventually taking on the role of arbiter.  

### Role in the Gang  

By 1899, Susan shared responsibilities for managing the gang's camp alongside Simon Pearson, the gang's cook. Together, they ensured that the camp was efficiently set up and organized every time the gang moved to a new location.  

Susan's strong will and no-nonsense attitude earned her respect and authority within the Van der Linde gang, making her an integral part of its operations.
