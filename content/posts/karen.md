# Karen Jones: The Scam Artist of the Van der Linde Gang  

**Role:** Outlaw, Con Artist  

Karen Jones was a crafty scam artist with a penchant for the outlaw lifestyle. Her sharp wit and ability to deceive made her a valuable member of the Van der Linde gang. Karen joined the gang sometime before 1899, quickly proving her worth with her cunning and resourcefulness.  

## A Life of Deception  

Karenâ€™s love for deception and trickery led her into a life of crime. Between 1895 and 1897, she played a key role in a bank robbery in Tucson, Arizona. Disguised as a nun, Karen worked alongside Arthur Morgan and Javier Escuella to pull off the heist, hiding firearms under her robes as part of the elaborate plan. Her ability to blend into her surroundings and fool unsuspecting targets made her an effective partner in crime.  

## Role in the Van der Linde Gang  

As a member of the Van der Linde gang, Karen's ability to think on her feet and manipulate situations was invaluable. Her charm and wit often helped the gang navigate through tricky situations, whether it involved swindling others or getting out of tight spots. However, her reckless behavior and love for chaos also made her unpredictable, and not everyone in the gang trusted her completely.  

## Legacy  

Karen Jones was one of the more colorful characters in the Van der Linde gang. While her skills as a con artist were undeniable, her impulsive and chaotic nature often put her at odds with the more level-headed members of the gang. Despite her flaws, Karen's contribution to the gang's criminal endeavors cannot be overlooked, and her story remains one of deception, risk, and the wild pursuit of the outlaw life.
