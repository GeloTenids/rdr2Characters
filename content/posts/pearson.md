# Simon Pearson: The Skilled Butcher and Cook  

**Born:** Unknown (likely mid-19th century)  
**Role:** Butcher, Cook, Camp Provisioner  

Simon Pearson’s life took a series of unexpected turns, leading him to become a crucial member of the Van der Linde gang. Born into a family of whale hunters, Pearson initially sought to follow in their footsteps. However, by the time he left school, the whaling industry had declined, leaving him to pursue other opportunities.  

## A Life at Sea  

Pearson's early adulthood took him to the sea, where he served as a sailor in the United States Navy, though the length of his service remains unclear. He claims to have traveled all over the world, including destinations like Java and Sumatra. One of his most memorable experiences was being stranded at sea for fifty days on a ship struck by plague—a traumatic event that led to a nostalgic longing for his time at sea.  

## Joining the Van der Linde Gang  

At some point before 1899, Pearson found himself in financial trouble. In need of help, he crossed paths with Dutch van der Linde and his gang, who rescued him from the clutches of loan sharks. In gratitude, Pearson became the gang's butcher and cook, roles that he excelled in, ensuring the gang was well-fed during their travels.  

## Role within the Gang  

Pearson’s contributions to the Van der Linde gang went beyond just providing meals. As the camp's cook, he was responsible for maintaining the gang's provisions, often preparing meals that boosted morale. Additionally, Pearson provided services that allowed the player to craft better gear or extra features for the camp, making him an integral part of the gang’s operations.
