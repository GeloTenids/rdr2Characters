## John Marston: Early Life and Journey into Outlawry

### Early Life (1873-1885)
John Marston was born in 1873 in the northern United States. His father was an illiterate Scottish immigrant born aboard a ship to New York, while his mother, a prostitute, tragically died during childbirth.  

John’s father, a man who loved Scotland and often spoke of it, initially raised him. However, after becoming blinded in a bar fight south of Chicago, he passed away under unclear circumstances when John was just eight years old. John was told his father died from injuries sustained in the bar fight, though the exact details remain uncertain.

After his father’s death, John was sent to an orphanage, where he spent several difficult years. Eventually, he ran away, choosing to survive on the streets. At the age of 11, John committed his first murder, although he later claimed it was not his fault.  

In 1885, at just 12 years old, John was caught stealing by a group of homesteaders in Illinois who planned to hang him. Dutch van der Linde intervened, saving the boy and taking him under his wing. John was inducted into the Van der Linde gang, joining figures like Hosea Matthews, Arthur Morgan, and Susan Grimshaw. The gang became a surrogate family for John, with Dutch serving as both a mentor and father figure. Dutch taught John how to read, shoot, hunt, and appreciate nature, instilling values beyond power and violence.

### Life in the Gang
John grew into a skilled and experienced outlaw, committing robberies, raids, and other crimes across the American frontier alongside the gang’s prominent members, including Arthur Morgan, Bill Williamson, and Javier Escuella.  

Dutch held John in high regard, often referring to him as one of his proudest protégés. Many members of the gang, including Arthur, believed John was Dutch’s favorite—a "golden boy" of sorts. This favoritism occasionally led to envy and resentment, particularly from individuals like Bill Williamson.  

John fully embraced Dutch’s philosophy, believing the gang’s actions had a higher purpose. They claimed to rob from the rich to help the poor and inspire change in the West. However, John later admitted that these beliefs often served as justification for their criminal activities.

### Family and Struggles
In 1894, Abigail Roberts, a prostitute, joined the gang. While she had relations with several members of the gang, she ultimately fell in love with John. The two had a son, Jack, in 1895. The gang embraced Jack as part of their extended family, with many members acting as his aunts and uncles.  

John struggled to connect with Jack in the early years, plagued by doubts about his paternity and fears about his own abilities as a father. This internal conflict caused John to leave the gang for a year around 1896. His return was welcomed by Dutch, Hosea, and other gang members, but Arthur Morgan felt betrayed by John’s absence. This led to a growing rift between the two over the following years.

### Legacy
John Marston’s journey from an orphaned street boy to a respected outlaw is a testament to his resilience and adaptability. While his loyalty to Dutch and the gang defined much of his life, his growing awareness of their moral failings would eventually lead him down a different path. His struggles with family, loyalty, and redemption form one of the most compelling arcs in *Red Dead Redemption 2*.

## Personality and Views of John Marston

### Dislikes and Imagination
John Marston is a man of strong convictions, yet he is not without his peculiarities. He has a strong dislike for birds and possesses a rather dull imagination, especially when compared to his son, Jack. Despite his often serious demeanor, John’s view of the world is pragmatic and shaped by his experiences rather than idealistic dreams.

### Religious Views
In terms of religion, John seems to lean toward Christianity, but he is not overtly religious. In-game quotes suggest that while he identifies with Christian values, he is not deeply devout or preoccupied with spiritual matters.

### Seriousness and Sarcasm
John is a no-nonsense, serious individual who has little patience for the eccentricities of those around him. His directness often leads him to deal harshly with others. For instance, he frequently threatens Irish into sobering up so that he can be of use, and he is visibly disturbed by Seth’s grave robbing habits. However, John is not without a sense of sarcasm, especially when conversing with those he sees as hypocrites. His interactions with characters like Abraham Reyes and Agustin Allende showcase his ability to wield sarcasm in the face of perceived moral failings.

### Moral Ambiguity and Family
John’s moral compass is guided by pragmatism, especially when it comes to his family. He is willing to engage in morally ambiguous actions, such as assisting both sides of the revolution in Mexico, in order to protect his loved ones. Despite his willingness to make tough choices, John holds strong convictions about loyalty, particularly to women and his family.

### Respect for Women and Loyalty
John is notably respectful toward women, often addressing them with courtesy and politeness. He calls Bonnie “Miss MacFarlane” despite her preference for “Bonnie” and takes great care to protect women, even going so far as to pistol-whip Irish to defend two nuns. He is also fiercely loyal to his wife, Abigail, and refuses to commit adultery. His irritation with those who mention his wife’s past, rather than focusing on his own, shows his deep commitment to her and their life together.

### Reluctance and Respect for Dutch
Despite the betrayal he experienced at the hands of Dutch van der Linde, John still holds a measure of respect for him as a father figure. Their bond, formed when Dutch took in a teenage John, is still evident, as John is reluctant to kill Dutch even when given the opportunity. Years after leaving the gang, John still carries some of Dutch’s progressive and less violent philosophical beliefs, such as a critical view of modern society and a disdain for the government. However, John has matured and is now firmly focused on leading a peaceful life with his family, distancing himself from his outlaw past.

### Cynicism and Disillusionment
John’s cynicism is evident in his view of government and power. He dismisses the automobile as “slow,” preferring the freedom of his horse, and he is skeptical of the government, stating that “most men can't handle power.” He recognizes the irony in murder being a crime “unless it's ordered by a court of law,” but does little to actively challenge the hypocrisy of society. Instead, he seems resigned to the idea that civilization is inherently flawed, filled with violence, corruption, and hypocrisy. John chooses to step away from this cycle, deciding to live a peaceful life as a rancher with his family, away from the chaos of the world.

### Legacy and Resolution
In contrast to many of his contemporaries, John has little tolerance for racism, even mocking those who hold such views. His journey represents a man who, despite his past, seeks to break free from the cycle of violence and corruption that defined his earlier years. By choosing a life with his family, he abandons the struggle to change the system, instead opting for peace and a fresh start.

John Marston’s character arc is a compelling exploration of loyalty, moral ambiguity, and the search for redemption. Though he remains cynical about the world, his desire to protect his family and live an honest life represents a significant evolution from his outlaw days.
