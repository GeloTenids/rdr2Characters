 # Arthur Morgan's Early Life

Arthur Morgan was born circa 1863 to Beatrice and Lyle Morgan in the northern United States. As a child, his mother died of unknown causes, while his father was a petty criminal and outlaw. In 1874, when Arthur was 11 years old, his father was arrested for larceny. Morgan later witnessed his death and, despite a strained relationship with him, still donned his hat and kept a picture of him.

## Joining the Van der Linde Gang

Around 1877, Arthur was found as a "wild delinquent" and picked up off the streets by **Dutch van der Linde** and **Hosea Matthews**. Viewing the pair as surrogate father figures, Arthur came to share Dutch's vision of a life lived free from the constraints of civilization and the rule of law. 

The pair taught him how to:
- Read
- Write
- Hunt
- Fight
- Shoot
- Ride

Arthur became their first protégé as well as one of the founding members of the **Van der Linde gang**. A little later, Arthur met Susan Grimshaw as she got close with Dutch and joined the gang, acting as a tough mother figure.
