# Abigail Marston: A Life of Struggle and Redemption  

**Born:** 1877 (as Abigail Roberts)  
**Role:** Gang Member, Mother  

Abigail Marston, born in 1877 as Abigail Roberts, had a turbulent and difficult early life. An orphan, Abigail was forced to turn to prostitution to survive. It was through this hardship that she eventually crossed paths with the Van der Linde gang, being introduced to them by Uncle in 1894.  

## The Early Years  

Abigail’s time as a prostitute led her to form relationships with several of the male members of the Van der Linde gang, including Arthur Morgan. Despite her earlier life, Abigail eventually found true love in John Marston, and by the time she was eighteen, she became pregnant with their son, Jack. Abigail decided to leave her former profession behind in order to build a family with John.  

## Family Life and Struggles  

Abigail and John’s relationship was often strained, particularly when John became unsure whether Jack was truly his child. This uncertainty led to John temporarily leaving the gang when Jack was about one year old, unwilling to face the responsibilities of fatherhood. However, John returned a year later, and despite their tensions, Abigail continued to care for him deeply. She tried to get John to be more involved in their son's life, but this led to several arguments, with John’s hesitance towards family life causing significant friction.  

## A Central Role in the Gang  

By 1899, Abigail had firmly integrated into the Van der Linde gang. While her focus remained on her family, particularly her son Jack, she played an important role in the camp, often helping to keep things in order.  

Abigail's relationship with the gang was somewhat distant due to her focus on her family, but she remained a supportive and respected member, particularly by John, who eventually acknowledged the importance of their life together.  

## Legacy  

Abigail Marston’s journey is one of redemption, love, and survival. Though she endured a hard life full of loss and pain, she ultimately found peace in her family. Her devotion to her son, Jack, and her relationship with John played a central role in the development of their lives and marked a key chapter in the Van der Linde gang’s history.
