# Micah Bell III: The Black Sheep of the Van der Linde Gang  

**Born:** Circa 1860  
**Role:** Gunman, Outlaw  

Micah Bell III was born around 1860 to Micah Bell Jr., a ruthless petty outlaw. Raised in a life of crime, Micah’s early years were steeped in violence and lawlessness. At the age of 17, in 1877, Micah and his father fled from authorities after committing a brutal double homicide. The victims, Roscoe and Jean Briggs, were hung from rafters with their throats slit. Micah likely served as his father’s partner-in-crime throughout his upbringing, but he also worked with his brother, Amos, for a time. However, the two had a significant falling out. By 1899, Amos had renounced his criminal past, settled in California with his family, and explicitly warned Micah to stay away, threatening to kill him if he ever came near.  

## A Life of Crime  

During his criminal career, Micah formed alliances with two outlaws named Cleet and Joe. He also participated in various criminal endeavors, including a failed bank robbery in the southern United States with a man named Norman. Micah’s violent tendencies and selfish nature made him both feared and despised by many.  

In 1898, Micah's fate changed when he met Dutch van der Linde in Crenshaw Hills, a town in the Grizzlies. Dutch, caught in a botched gold deal, found himself in danger, and Micah intervened, saving Dutch’s life. Impressed by Micah’s skills and audacity, Dutch invited him to join the Van der Linde gang. While Dutch took a liking to Micah, others in the gang—particularly Arthur Morgan, John Marston, and Hosea Matthews—viewed him as reckless, argumentative, and dangerous.  

## The Blackwater Heist  

After five months in the gang, Micah proposed a plan to rob a ferry in Blackwater, promising a substantial reward despite the high risk. Dutch, swayed by the potential payoff, chose Micah’s plan over an alternative lead from Arthur and Hosea. The heist turned into a disaster. A fierce gun battle with the Pinkertons ensued, forcing the gang to flee. Their escape led them into the snowy mountains of Ambarino, but the cost was severe—Jenny Kirk and Davey Callander were fatally injured, and Mac Callander was captured and killed by the Pinkertons.  

## Legacy  

Micah Bell III remains one of the most divisive figures in the Van der Linde gang. His cunning, combat prowess, and loyalty to Dutch made him a valuable asset, but his arrogance, recklessness, and penchant for violence alienated many of his fellow outlaws. To some, Micah was an opportunist willing to do whatever it took to survive, even if it meant betraying those closest to him.
