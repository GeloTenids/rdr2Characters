# Tilly Jackson: The Outlaw with a Rough Past  

**Role:** Outlaw  

Tilly Jackson’s life was shaped by hardship and violence from a young age. Born to a former slave, Tilly’s early years were filled with pain and loss. At just 12 years old, she was kidnapped by the Foreman Brothers, a gang of outlaws. Forced into their criminal life, Tilly was exposed to brutality and danger.  

## A Violent Escape  

Tilly’s time with the Foreman Brothers was marked by violence, particularly when she killed Malcolm, Anthony Foreman's cousin, in self-defense. After Malcolm made unwanted advances toward her, Tilly slit his throat and fled the gang, determined to escape her captors. She returned to her mother’s workplace, only to discover that her mother had passed away.  

## A New Beginning  

Tilly’s life took a turning point when she crossed paths with Dutch van der Linde. Dutch, who had a reputation for helping those in need, came to Tilly’s rescue when she was in trouble. Like he had done with Arthur Morgan and John Marston, Dutch saved Tilly and raised her as one of his own. In addition to offering her protection, Dutch taught Tilly how to read and imparted his own philosophies about freedom and rebellion.  

## Role in the Van der Linde Gang  

Tilly became a trusted member of the Van der Linde gang, where she found a sense of belonging and family. Though young, she proved herself capable and loyal. She viewed Dutch as a surrogate father and was deeply grateful for the kindness he had shown her. Her past filled her with a sense of strength and resolve, making her a valuable member of the gang despite the difficulties she faced growing up.  

## Legacy  

Tilly Jackson's journey from a kidnapped child to an outlaw was a testament to her resilience and determination. While she had a troubled past, Dutch’s guidance helped her become a fierce and loyal member of the gang. Her story is one of survival, redemption, and the power of finding a new family when the old one is lost.
