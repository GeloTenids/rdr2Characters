# Background

Born to an African American father and a Native American mother, Charles Smith became one of the most recent additions to the Van der Linde gang, joining roughly 6-7 months before the events of the game.

Charles recalls that he and his father lived with his motherâ€™s tribe until the U.S. Army drove them away. His mother was captured by soldiers a couple of years later and was never seen again, while his father fell into a depression and became an alcoholic. At the age of 13, Charles ran away and wandered the country alone.

A veteran survivalist, Charles eventually joined the Van der Linde gang while in the Grizzlies, sometime in late 1898.
