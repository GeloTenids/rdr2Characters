# Bill Williamson: A Life of Violence and Redemption  

**Born:** Circa 1869-1872  
**Role:** Gunman, Outlaw  

Bill Williamson, born Marion Williamson, came into the world between 1869 and 1872. Embarrassed by his first name, he later adopted the name "Bill" after his surname, distancing himself from his family’s legacy. His father was an alcoholic, and Bill lived in constant fear of inheriting his father’s fate, especially after witnessing the toll excessive drinking took on his father’s health.  

## A Troubled Youth  

From an early age, Bill exhibited signs of delinquency. His rebellious nature persisted even after being sent to reform school, but he continued down a path of crime, accumulating a growing criminal record. Bill’s struggles were further compounded by the instability of his family life, and he found himself unable to escape the cycle of violence and destruction.  

## Military Service and Discharge  

At some point, Bill joined the Army and served with the 15th Infantry, claiming to have also served in the cavalry. His time in the military was marked by violence, particularly against Native Americans, and his experience in the Army left him with deep psychological scars. Eventually, Bill was dishonorably discharged on December 27, 1892, due to deviant behavior and attempted murder. Following his discharge, Bill lived a rough life, drinking heavily and resorting to highway robbery to survive.  

## The Encounter with Dutch  

In 1893, during one of his robberies, Bill tried to hold up Dutch van der Linde and Hosea Matthews. However, he was caught off guard when they revealed they had already stolen his ammunition. Rather than retaliating, Dutch and Hosea laughed at him, and this lighthearted moment sparked something in Bill. Dutch offered him a place in the Van der Linde gang, giving Bill a sense of purpose and direction. Although Bill was deeply troubled by the horrors he had witnessed during his time in the Army, he saw the gang as a chance for redemption.  

## Life with the Van der Linde Gang  

For the next six years, Bill served as a gunman for the Van der Linde gang. He participated in numerous criminal activities, including robberies, raids, murder, kidnapping, and other misdeeds across the frontier. While his skills as a gunman were unquestioned, Bill’s violent tendencies and emotional scars often made him unpredictable. Despite his flaws, he remained loyal to Dutch and found a sense of camaraderie in the gang, even as his personal demons continued to haunt him.  

## Legacy  

Bill Williamson’s life was defined by violence, personal struggle, and the quest for redemption. From a troubled youth to a seasoned outlaw, his journey was marked by moments of darkness and flashes of humanity. His time in the Van der Linde gang provided him with a sense of belonging, but it did little to erase the scars of his past. Bill’s story serves as a reminder of the consequences of a life spent in conflict and the search for a place to call home.
