# Leopold Strauss: The Accountant and Loan Shark  

**Born:** Circa 1846, Vienna, Austrian Empire  
**Role:** Accountant, Loan Shark  

Leopold Strauss' life began in poverty in the city of Vienna, Austria, where he experienced hardship from a young age. By the time he was twelve, Strauss had already witnessed the life of crime firsthand, as his brother became a petty crook, beating night watchmen for food scraps. However, the true tragedy struck when Strauss’ father sold his youngest sister, Anna, into bonded labor to provide for the rest of the family—a decision that deeply affected Leopold and his siblings.  

## A Troubled Journey to America  

At the age of seventeen, Strauss was sent to the United States with his uncle in the hopes of escaping his grim circumstances. However, upon arriving in the middle of the New York City draft riots of 1863, Strauss' uncle suffered a fatal heart attack, leaving him stranded in an unfamiliar land. Alone and with few resources, Strauss resorted to running various illegitimate scams to survive in the chaos of post-Civil War America.  

## Joining the Van der Linde Gang  

It wasn’t until years later that Strauss crossed paths with Dutch van der Linde. After years of running scams, Strauss caught the attention of Dutch, who saw potential in him. Strauss was inducted into the Van der Linde gang, where he became the group's accountant and eventually established a loan sharking business. His ability to handle the gang's finances, as well as his shady dealings, made him a valuable but morally questionable member of the crew.  

## Role within the Gang  

Strauss played a key role in managing the gang’s finances. He handled the books, collected debts, and facilitated loan sharking activities, often pressuring debtors into paying by any means necessary. His dealings put him at odds with many of the gang's more morally driven members, particularly Arthur Morgan, who viewed Strauss' methods as ruthless. However, his financial expertise was crucial to the gang's ability to operate, allowing them to fund their criminal activities and maintain their lifestyle.  

## Legacy  

Leopold Strauss' legacy within the Van der Linde gang is one of financial cunning and moral ambiguity. While he contributed significantly to the gang's success by managing its finances and starting a loan sharking business, his methods left a bitter taste among some of the other members. Strauss’ rise from a poor Viennese childhood to a manipulative loan shark is a testament to his resilience and willingness to exploit others to secure his place within the gang.
