# Josiah Trelawny: The Trickster and Conman  

**Born:** Cornwall, England (Exact year unknown)  
**Role:** Conman, Trickster  

Josiah Trelawny’s life began in Cornwall, England, though he has little recollection of his early years. At some point, he emigrated to the United States, where his talent for deception and trickery eventually found a home in the criminal underworld. Trelawny, a self-proclaimed conjuror and trickster, became known for his cunning schemes and ability to manipulate others, which made him a perfect fit for the Van der Linde gang.  

## A Life of Disappearing Acts  

Trelawny’s connection with the Van der Linde gang dates back several years before 1899. As a conman, he was known for his ability to charm and deceive others, often using his wits to extricate himself from tricky situations. However, Trelawny’s loyalty to the gang was always in question, as he had a habit of abandoning them for months at a time. Despite his sporadic disappearances, he always returned, making him a somewhat unreliable yet undeniably skilled member of the crew.  

## Life in Saint Denis  

At one point, Trelawny tried to settle down, establishing a family life in Saint Denis with a wife and two sons, Tarquin and Cornelius. However, his tendency to vanish without a trace led to a fractured family dynamic. Trelawny’s reappearances were as sudden as his departures, creating a sense of instability for those closest to him.  

## Role within the Gang  

Though his contributions were often uncertain due to his erratic behavior, Trelawny played a role in the gang’s operations as a conman. His ability to deceive and manipulate people made him useful during certain heists and operations that required a finesse for trickery. However, his inconsistent presence in the gang left some members, particularly Arthur Morgan and Dutch, wary of his true intentions.  

## Legacy  

Josiah Trelawny’s legacy within the Van der Linde gang is one of unpredictability and charm. While his ability to deceive others proved valuable in certain situations, his unreliability and frequent disappearances made him a difficult figure to trust. Despite this, Trelawny’s cunning and smooth-talking nature earned him a place in the gang’s history, even if his role was often in the background.
