# Sean MacGuire: The Bold Irishman  

**Born:** Ireland (presumably Donegal)  
**Role:** Gunman, Outlaw  

Sean MacGuire's life was one of mischief, rebellion, and unexpected encounters. Born in Ireland to Darragh MacGuire, a notorious Fenian outlaw, Sean grew up amidst the turbulence of his father's criminal activities. The family eventually fled to America to escape the law, but Darragh was hunted down and killed, leaving young Sean to fend for himself. Sent to a reform school, Sean's rebellious nature proved uncontainable, and he soon found himself on the streets of North Elizabeth.  

## A Fateful Encounter with Dutch and Hosea  

Sean's path crossed with Dutch van der Linde and Hosea Matthews in a bar in North Elizabeth. Drawn by Dutch's flashy pocket watch, Sean followed the pair into a dark alleyway, where he attempted to rob them at gunpoint. Much to his surprise, Dutch and Hosea simply laughed at his attempt and dared him to shoot. In a twist of fate, it was revealed that Dutch and Hosea had already spotted Sean and silently removed the bullets from his gun. Rather than ending his life, Dutch and Hosea saw potential in the young man and, offering him food, invited him to join the Van der Linde gang.  

## Life in the Van der Linde Gang  

Sean became known for his boldness and impulsive nature, often acting as the comic relief within the gang. Though his actions were sometimes reckless, his loyalty to Dutch and the gang was unquestionable. Over time, Sean grew to become a trusted member of the crew, taking part in various robberies and conflicts. Despite his often carefree attitude, he was capable of serious action when the situation called for it.
