# Uncle: The Eccentric Storyteller  

**Born:** Ohio (prior to 1849)  
**Role:** Elderly Member of the Van der Linde Gang  

Uncle’s early life was marked by hardship and a series of odd experiences. Born in Ohio before the fall of 1849, Uncle was raised in a tumultuous environment. He lost both of his parents when he was just nine years old, forcing him to become self-reliant and “live on his wits.” He often tells stories of his past, though the authenticity of these tales is highly questionable.  

## A Life of Adventure and Strange Claims  

Throughout his life, Uncle wandered far and wide, experiencing various oddities. He speaks of his time in Africa, where he claims to have sold camping supplies in East Africa and was once worshipped as a god by the locals in the Congo. Whether these stories are true or merely fanciful fabrications remains unclear. He also mentions being known as the "one-shot kid" in his youth, although this too seems to be more of a tall tale.  

At some point before 1894, Uncle joined the Van der Linde gang. His role within the gang was minimal, primarily because of his age, alcoholism, and unproductive nature. Despite his eccentricities and questionable contributions, Uncle remained a fixture in the gang.  

## Involvement with the Gang  

Uncle’s contribution to the Van der Linde gang was mainly social, acting as a storyteller and adding a touch of comedy to the group dynamic. He introduced Abigail Roberts to the gang in 1894, who would later become John Marston’s partner and the mother of their son, Jack. Uncle's involvement in the gang’s criminal activities was limited, but he did accompany Arthur Morgan and Bill Williamson on a bank robbery near Canada. As the lookout, Uncle’s performance was notably poor, with Arthur commenting that he was not very good at it.  

## Legacy  

Uncle’s legacy within the Van der Linde gang is one of mischief, strange tales, and minimal contribution to the gang’s operations. While he was never a key player in the gang's criminal endeavors, his eccentricities, humor, and occasional odd jobs made him a memorable character. His stories—whether true or not—remained a part of the gang's social fabric, and his role as the elder, drunken member brought a certain charm to the group.
